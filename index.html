        ''Among the many Fixers of the Backstreets, she was one of the few who
        could go toe to toe with the Head and the Claw. She was called the Red
        Mist among the Backstreets' denizens. That was a name she earned
        protecting us from all kinds of threats and maneuvers from the
        outside.''

        Kali (칼리, Kali) was a legendary Color Fixer titled The Red Mist from
        the Backstreets of District 23. She was renowned throughout the City for
        her immense strength and her sense of justice as a protector of the
        weak. After meeting Carmen, she joined the Seed of Light Project team,
        and through their research she gained the E.G.O. weapon Mimicry and
        became able to manifest her own E.G.O. as well. Kali was ultimately
        killed in the Outskirts defending the research team against an attack by
        the Head, though she killed two Claws and mortally wounded the Arbiter
        Garion in return. To the City, she simply disappeared, and is
        memorialized as a hero. Gebura is the "reincarnation" of Kali, having
        been created from her remains and possessing her memories.

      Angela, you have to feel the same sorrow as mine... No. You have to feel
      even worse than that. You took Angelica from me--she meant the world to
      me. I sat on my hands as I watched people I knew die, and I even killed my
      own best friend with these shadowed gloves, just for this moment. All for
      this moment... I've been suppressing my emotions, forcing this pained
      smile.
